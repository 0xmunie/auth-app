# 🛡️ Auth App

A simple and secure authentication system built with **Express.js**, **Sequelize**, and **MySQL**.  
This project focuses on the security implementations that every developer should follow when designing an authentication flow.

## 🔐 Key Security Features

- Input **validation and sanitization** at every entry point  
- Strong **OTP verification and password reset** mechanisms  
- **Hashed** and **unpredictable** sensitive data (passwords, OTPs)
- **Rate limiting** HTTP Requests preventing brute-force attacks
- **JWT** securely implemented to prevent common token attacks  
- Thoughtfully designed **logic flow** to avoid logic-based vulnerabilities

## 💡 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a customizable and secure authentication flow that doesn't rely on specific tools, libraries, or even languages.
Instead, the focus is on building a secure mechanism — from validating and processing input data to creating a safe logic flows.  

Any developer can modify or extend the system by adding new features, as long as they follow the same security principles applied throughout the existing codebase.

And if you're using different web technologies — which you likely will — applying these same security practices will save development time and help ensure your authentication flow remains secure and reliable.
